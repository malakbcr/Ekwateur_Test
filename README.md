## Model

The model package contains the business entities of the application:

* OfferDto: object representing an offer.
* OfferDetailsDto: object representing the details of an offer.
* PromoCodeDto: object representing a promo code
* OfferType: type of offer
* CompatibleOfferDto: object representing the final result of compatible offers with a specific promoCode that will be used later to create the json file
* Urls: object representing urls

## Service

The services layer of the application contains model's uses case

## Exception

The exception model contains generic exception to which we add a personalized error message
* InvalidCodeException : thrown if expired or not found promoCode
* IncompatibleOfferException : thrown if No compatible offer found

## Configuration

The configuration package contains services that are responsible for accessing to the API and retrieving resources.

----

A log file is generated by date which contains the logs: info, warn and errors

The api urls are in a config.json file in the resource package

The json file that contains compatible Offers will be generated in the project racin folder

If the json file will not be created that's because the promoCode is not valid (Expired or Not found) or no offer is compatible for this code.

#### _**REMARK** : The actual promoCode Api contains only expired codes._**
